## About Me

Since an adolescent, I have been fascinated with technology, computers, and the world wide web. I made static webpages in my youth and even got to deploy some flash-centric wonders. Over the years my love of technology and computers only grew more powerful - occasionally doing activities on FreeCodeCamp and taking computer science courses at the local community college. Most recently I completed a Coding Bootcamp, by Trilogy/UC Davis Continuing Education, earning a certificate in Full Stack Web Development. I hope to continue to grow as a web developer and as a person.
